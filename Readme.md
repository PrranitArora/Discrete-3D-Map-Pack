# Project Description

Creating detailed 3D environments for games / experiences in virtual reality is a labor intensive process, especially when trying to accurately model real life areas. Using 360-degree cameras with some sort of distance gauge is a solution, but this setup is clunky, hard to keep stable and can bring unwanted attention from nearby people, ruining the map. By packaging the sensors discretely in a backpack, only having small holes / one-way tints cut out for cameras and other sensors, you can create discrete real-time modeling. * this would require some sort of lidar setup, covering front and back. This setup will have an appendage that extends out front as well (wires hidden under clothes). 
Applications: - creating virtual reality experiences - creating 3d tours of places - reliving places you visit - can be used for advertising real life experiences - potential safety related applications: using computer vision to analyze all around you in real time
